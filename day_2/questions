1. write a python program to find the best of 2 test average marks out of 3 tests marks accepted from the user
2. develop a python program to convert a binary number into decimal, octal and hexadecimal numbers using functions
3. define a function Fn as Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2. write a python program that accepts a value for N where N>0 as input and pass this value to the function. Display the suitable error for input value is not followed
4. write a python program to find the string similarity between two given strings
5. write a pyton program that accepts a sentence and finds the number of words, digits, uppercase letters and lowercase letters

Patterns:
    steps to solve:
        1. see the number of rows and apply a loop for it
        2. see the number of columns and apply a loop
        3. check for any relationship between rows and columns
        4. print the required character
        5. check for where to print spaces

1. write a program to read a string from user and implement the logic to remove the characters
   which are at the odd no's of the index
