collections: collections are used to store multiple values in a single place

4 types:
    List []: collection of items which are ordered, changable and allows duplicates

    Tuples (): collection of items which are ordered and allows duplicates but doesn't allow changes

    Sets {}: collection of items which are unordered changable but doesn't support duplicates

    Dictionary {key:value}: collections of items in a key value pair manner, no duplicates, changable and ordered

eg:
li = ["cat", "dog", "rat", "pig"]

li[1:3] = ["camel"]
=>  ["cat", "camel", "pig"]


li[1:3] = ["camel","duck", "ant"]
=>  ["cat", "camel","duck", "ant", "pig"]
